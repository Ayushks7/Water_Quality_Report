# Water_Quality_Report
📊 Overview
This project analyzes the Water Quality Dataset sourced from Kaggle to determine factors affecting the potability (drinkability) of water. It involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, correlation analysis, and feature exploration to uncover patterns that influence water quality and safety.

The goal is to provide insights that can help in identifying critical water quality indicators and supporting public health and environmental decision-making.
📁 Dataset
Source: Kaggle - Water Potability Dataset

Features:

pH

Hardness

Solids

Chloramines

Sulfate

Conductivity

Organic Carbon

Trihalomethanes

Turbidity

Potability (Target: 0 = Not Safe, 1 = Safe)

🎯 Objectives
🔍 Data Exploration: Understand the structure, features, and quality of the dataset.

📈 Insight Generation: Identify key factors influencing water potability.

📊 Visualization: Use plots (scatter, pair, heatmaps, bar charts) to reveal patterns and trends.

🤖 (Optional) Predictive Modeling: Explore basic models for potability classification.

🧠 Recommendation: Provide insights for water quality improvement policies.

📌 Key Findings
Certain features like pH, Solids, and Chloramines show strong correlations with potability.

Water with extreme pH or high levels of solids tends to be non-potable.

Visualizations like scatter plots and heatmaps helped uncover key feature interactions.

The dataset had missing values that were handled with mean/mode imputation.

🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used
Google Colab

Python (Pandas, NumPy)

Seaborn & Matplotlib

Scikit-learn (for optional modeling)

Git & GitHub

📷 Visualizations
Feature correlation heatmap

Scatter plots between variables (e.g., pH vs Hardness)

Bar charts for average values by pH range

Pair plots to examine overall feature relationships

📌 Conclusion
The analysis revealed important insights into what makes water safe for consumption. These findings could help water management authorities and public health organizations better monitor and manage water quality. The study also sets a foundation for more advanced models and real-time systems in the future.

📚 Future Work
Develop classification models to predict water potability.

Integrate real-time water quality sensors.

Expand dataset with geographic tagging for location-specific analysis.
